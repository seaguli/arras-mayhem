## Requirements:
- A Private Arras Server. (incompatible with kot32 arras servers.)
- Remixed version of this.
# Important: Don't use Name Colors yet because it may reveal your server token. you may still use this template because this template has a few fixes.
****
## Instructions:
- You dont need to touch the server.
1. Navigate to bundle.js, column 3223.
2. Change 'arras-template' to your private server name.
#### If you want Name Colors:
4. Navigate to bundle.js, column 557.
5. Change the "" to "(your token)". Don't use brackets.
Important Note: don't forget to obfuscate or encode your bundle.js or anyone that can visit this client can search and see it. 
- don't forget to credit me :) (jk)
